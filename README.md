# Dual-zone temperature control

**[*Project Description*](https://stackedit.io)** : Code of a prototype that de-risk the dual zone temperature in the same room engineering challenge.

**[*How to Install and Run the Project*](https://stackedit.io)** : 

![Hardware](https://github.com/JuanDavidGA/Dual_zone_temperature_control/blob/main/Hardware%20level.jpg)

Hardware consists of: 
*  11 ESP microcontrollers
*  6 temperature sensors
*  4 relays
*  4 heaters

![topology](https://github.com/JuanDavidGA/Dual_zone_temperature_control/blob/main/Topology.jpg)

It is important to stick to the setup: 
*  3 temperature sensors surrounding each special spot 
*  1 heater per wall

![redzone](https://github.com/JuanDavidGA/Dual_zone_temperature_control/blob/main/Red%20zone.png)

Important notes:  
*  Zone can be any size 
*  Special spot can not be located in the red zone

**[*How to Use the Project*](https://stackedit.io)** :
<ul><li>Upload heater control to the main/server ESP</li><li>Upload sensor_node code in the 6 EPS temperature nodes</li><li>Upload realy_node code in the 4 EPS relay nodes</li><li>

**Useful Code Snippets for the Temperature Sensor:**
    
    # Creates a ds18x20 object called temp_sensor on the sensor_pin defined earlier
    temp_sensor = ds18x20.DS18X20(onewire.OneWire(sensor_pin))
    
    # Scans for the DS18B20 sensors and saves the address found... returns a list with the address
    DS18B20_address = temp_sensor.scan()
        
    # Needed everytime we want to read the temp
    temp_sensor.convert_temp() 
    time.sleep_ms(750) # Delay of 750 ms to give enough time to convert the temperature
        
    # Return the temperature in Celcius
    temp_sensor.read_temp(DS18B20_address[0])

    spi = machine.SPI(1, sck=machine.Pin(14), mosi=machine.Pin(13), miso=machine.Pin(12))
    #sck in the ESP is CLK on the SD Card Module
    #mosi or Pin(13) in the ESP is DI on the SD Card Module 
    #miso or Pin(12) in the ESP is DO on the SD Card Module  
    #GPIO Pin(18) is cs on the SD Card Module
        
    # Makes an SD card object  
    sdcard = sdcard.SDCard(spi, cs)
    # Makes the SD card the new root filesystem 
    vfs = os.VfsFat(sdcard)
    os.mount(vfs, "/sd")
